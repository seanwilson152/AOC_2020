# AOC_2020
Advent of code programming competition (lets see how far I get this year :)) . For AoC 2020 the goal is to write all solutions sin nodejs.

## Setup
Run "npm install"

Puzzel input files should be saved as "input.txt" in the folders which correspond to each days puzzel. My input files are already there but different puzzel inputs are generated by AoC for each   

.

## To Run a Solution
Run "node AoC20 --day {AoC Day}" 

For example the command "node AoC20 --day 1" will run the solutions for day 1

Appending "--debug" to the command above will run the solution with the small debug example proved in the AoC question.

.

## developement 
The main launcher AoC20 reads puzzel inputs and dynamically loads and executes puzzel solutions based on the commandline args passed. To add a new puzzel solution just create another "DAY" folder and include in it :
* index.js -> should export two functions that solve puzzel part1 and part2 respectivly
* input.txt -> puzzel input from AoC
* debug.txt -> puzzel inpt example included in AoC question
