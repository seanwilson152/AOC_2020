# AOC_2020
Advent of code programming competition (lets see how far I get this year :)) . For AoC 2020 the goal is to write all solutions sin nodejs.

## Setup
Run "npm install"

puzzle input files should are saved as "input.txt" in the folders which correspond to each days puzzle. My input files are already there, but different puzzle inputs are generated by AoC for each participant. 

.

## To Run a Solution
Use the launcher script. Run "node AoC20 --day {AoC Day}" 

For example the command "node AoC20 --day 1" would run the solutions for day 1

Appending "--debug" to the command above will run the solution with the small debug example proved in the AoC question.

.

## developement 
The main launcher AoC20 reads puzzle inputs and dynamically loads and executes puzzle solutions based on the commandline args passed. This saves me writing the same code every day to load the input from file & format it. To create a new solution I execute the setupSolution.js script in "automation", passing the "--day" as a command arg. It will create new folder with the following files:
* index.js -> exports two functions that solve puzzle part1 and part2 respectively
* input.txt -> puzzle input from AoC (this is pulled pulled from the AoC server)
* debug.txt -> puzzle input example included in AoC question
